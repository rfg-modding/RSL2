# RSL2
Redesign/re-write of the [RSL (Remarstered Script Loader)](https://github.com/rsl-dev/RSL) aiming to learn from the mistakes in design and direction of the original RSL. Due to the amount of issues with the old codebase and how clunky it had become to develop for it was easier just to start from scratch and take a new approach.

Parts of the design of RSL2 are inspired or directly copied from [DashFaction](https://github.com/rafalh/dashfaction), a Red Faction 1 Community Patch. Notably it's code injection and function hooking / patching code.
